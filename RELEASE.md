# ⚙️ Bug fixes and Improvements

- Added chained configs beside raw configs. This way, when **Chain Proxy** stops working, you still have access to non-chained configs
- Improved **Chain Proxy** and **Warp** DNS resolution
- Fixed chain proxy `Httpupgrade` transmission bug for sing-box and Clash
- Fixed Clash chain proxy bug

> [!CAUTION]
> If you already have a Chain Proxy set in panel, after updating to this version you have to clear it, apply and then set it again.

> [!CAUTION]
> sing-box client version should be 1.12.0 or higher
